                <h3>TLDR:</h3>
                <p>Please buy drink vouchers in advance to order mixed drinks, beer and extra wine at the bar. We will cover a welcome drink and wine with dinner.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Why vouchers?</h3>
                <p>Because of the venue, we have to buy all of the alcohol and supplies for the bar. This is actually better for you (our 
                    guests) because alcohol prices in Norway are ridiculous compared to the US and UK (a mixed drink at a bar in oslo can cost 
                    between 16 and 20USD or more). We will of course be covering the cost of the welcome-drink and the wine served at dinner,
                    but we will be charging (a very affordable amount) for anything outside of this. </p>

                <h3>Disclaimer!</h3> 
                <p><b>There will also be alcohol-free versions of the cocktails we manage to organize.</b> These will be free of course.
                I don't want to make any promises about the cocktail menu yet, but we really want to make pi√±a coladas and margaritas with a 
                slushie machine! I will update the website with the menu when we figure out what's realistic.</p>
                    
                <h3>Drinking Vouchers</h3>
                <p>To save time and because of the alcohol-serving laws in Norway, we ask that you buy drink-vouchers in advance. You can use 
                    these to order any drink of your choice at the bar, including beer, wine and possibly home-brewed hard cider. If you don't 
                    get enough vouchers in advance, we will also set things up so that you can purchase some on-site as a last resort. Buying 
                    vouchers in advance also gives us a good idea of how much alcohol we need to buy in, so this is the preferred method. 
                </p>
                <p><b>I will set up the payment options via this website as soon as possible.</b></p>
